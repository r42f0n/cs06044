a.       Calculate the mean and standard   deviation   for the   sample   of   stock prices.   (2 marks)
b.       Calculate the five number summary for the sample of   stock prices.   (2   marks)
c.       Calculate lower and upper fences   for the   sample   of   stock prices.   (2 marks)
d.       Using   your   answers   above   and/   or   otherwise,   draw   a box-plot   for the   sample   of stock prices. Hint: Ensure that your box-plot is in line with best principles for the visual presentation of statistical information. (4 marks)
Question 2 (10 Marks) 
A roulette wheel has   37 numbers   in total   (ranging   from   0   to   36)   and the following properties:
●          18 red, 18 black and 1 green number 
●          18 odd and 18 even numbers 
●          12 low, 12 mid-range and 12 high numbers 
●          A left column (C1) for the numbers 1, 4, 7, …, 34 
●          A middle column (C2) for the numbers 2, 5, 8, …, 35 
● A right column (C3) for the numbers 3, 6, 9, …, 36
The   graphic   to   the   right   demonstrates   the   relationships   between all   of   the   properties   discussed   above.
‘Red’   numbers   are   circled   and   ‘Black’   numbers   are   circled   and   filled with black.The   ‘Green’   number   (zero)   is   neither   circled   nor   circled   and   filled   in black.   It   is   separate   from   all   other   categories –   it   is not   black   nor   is   it   red,   not   even/odd,   not   low/mid-range/high,   not   left/middle/right. It   is   by   itself.
a.       What is the probability of   a low C3 number coming up   on   a   single turn?   (1   mark)
b.       What is the probability of   seeing high numbers on 3 consecutive turns?   (2 marks)
c.       What   is   the   conditional   probability   of an   even   number   coming   up   on   a   single   turn   given   that   you   know   that   the   number   which   came   up   is   amid-range   black   number? (2 marks)
d.       Let   event ‘E   ’   be   a roulette   spin which   lands   on   an   even   number,   event   ‘L’   be   a   roulette   spin   which   lands   on   a   low   number,   and   event   ‘B’   be   a   roulette   spin   which   lands   on   a   black   number.

i)                         Which number on the roulette wheel makes   the   following   statement   true: P(E′   ∩ L   ∩ B)   ≠   0   ?   (1 mark)
ii)                      True or False:   Z   ∩   E′   ∩   L   ∩   B   =   φ. Hint: Mutually exclusive. (1   mark)
iii)                   Use the   conditional probability   P(Z      │   E   ′   ∩   L   ∩   B)   to   show   that   event   Z   is   not   independent   of   event E′   ∩ L   ∩ B.   (3   marks)
Question 3 (10 Marks) You   are   a   graduate   auditor   at   EY   and   you’ve   been   asked   by   your   manager   to   verify   the   accuracy   of 4   invoices   issued   by   a   client   firm   which   EY   is   auditing.   Your   manager   informs   you   that,   based   on   prior   year   audits, the   probability   of   an   invoice   being   accurate   is   60%.
a.       Which method for assigning probabilities has your manager used in his   estimation?   (1 mark)
b.       What is the probability that exactly   1 of   the 4 sampled invoices   is   accurate?   (1 mark)
c.       State one assumption which underlies your   calculation   in part   (b). Hint: There are several to choose from. (1 mark)
d.       What is the probability that at least two of   the sampled invoices   are   accurate?   (3   marks)
e.       Using   the   probabilities   calculated   above   and/   or   otherwise,    graph   the   PDF   which   applies   to   your sample   of   invoices. Hint: Ensure that your PDF is complete and is in line with best principles for the visual presentation of statistical information. (4 marks)
Question 4 (10 Marks) 
The   estimator  produces   individual   estimates  for   μ the   mean   of a   population.   Use   this   information to answer the following questions:
a.       Assuming you’re sampling without replacement, how many sample means does the sampling distribution of  contain if   n = 20 and N = 35?   (2   marks)
b.       Assuming   you’re   sampling with   replacement,   how   many   samples   of size   n   = 10   does   the   sampling distribution   of  contain   if   there   are   23 observations   in   the   population? (1 mark)
c.       State the mathematical rule which describes the   statistical bias   of .   (1 mark)
d.       Is  a consistent estimator? Explain why or   why not. (2 marks)
e.  is the MVUE for μ. Carefully explain what this means.   (2   marks)
f.         Calculate the standard error of   the  sampling distribution.
